# SABnzbd Glitter - Night UserCSS Script

CSS &copy; 2017/2018 [Kris McCann](https://github.com/AJCrowley) - [krismccann@gmail.com](mailto:krismccann@gmail.com)

Some simple CSS enhancements for SABnzbd's Glitter skin (night version).

To use, just install a UserCSS browser extension, I use [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), as it allows you to define different CSS adaptions by URL, so these mods won't be applied to all servers on your localhost. To limit the mods to SABnzbd, just enclose it in the following CSS, modifying for whichever port your SABnzbd server is running on:
```css
@-moz-document url-prefix("http://127.0.0.1:6060/sabnzbd/") {
	/* css changes live here /=
}
```

There are however plenty of options, depending upon your browser, but I've found this one to be the best for my purposes.

Enjoy!
