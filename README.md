# SABNZBd Plush UserCSS Script

CSS &copy; 2017/2018 [Kris McCann](https://github.com/AJCrowley) - [krismccann@gmail.com](mailto:krismccann@gmail.com)



Some simple CSS enhancements for SABNZBd's default Plush skin.

To use, just install a UserCSS browser extension, I use [User CSS for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb), but there are a number of options, depending upon your browser.

Once the extension is installed, navigate to your SAB instance ([default link](http://localhost:6060/sabnzbd)), press the User CSS icon in your toolbar (or whatever action is appropriate for the browser extension that you installed), and paste the contents of the CSS file into the CSS pane.

Enjoy!
