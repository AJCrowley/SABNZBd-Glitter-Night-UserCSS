# TweetDeck UserCSS Script

CSS &copy; 2017/2018 [Kris McCann](https://github.com/AJCrowley) - [krismccann@gmail.com](mailto:krismccann@gmail.com)



Some simple CSS enhancements for TweetDeck.com.

This stylesheet modifies the columns to fill the browser, does away with the round avatars, and makes a number of other tweaks that improve the look and feel of TweetDeck.

To use, just install a UserCSS browser extension, I use [User CSS for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb), but there are a number of options, depending upon your browser.

Once the extension is installed, navigate to [TweetDeck.com](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), press the User CSS icon in your toolbar (or whatever action is appropriate for the browser extension that you installed), and paste the contents of the CSS file into the CSS pane.

Alternatively, if you're using the [BetterTweetDeck](https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck), it has custom CSS baked right into the options. I highly recommend this extension in conjunction with my custom CSS to provide the optimum TweetDeck experience! You can install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bettertweetdeck/micblkellenpbfapmcpcfhcoeohhnpob?hl=en).

Enjoy TweetDeck as it should be!
